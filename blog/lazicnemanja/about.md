Nemanja Lazic wants to live in a world where emails are short, internet is free, music is everywhere, and there's no war.

As a software developer and musician , he’s been spotlighted on [soundcloud/lazyk123](https://soundcloud.com/lazyk123), [soundcloud/lazyk123](https://soundcloud.com/andrei-korre), [bandcamp](http://nemanjalazic.bandcamp.com/).

When he’s not programming, you can find him in a pub, concert or a music studio.
